# Face Emotion Detection

Here is the [Reposity](https://github.com/kushal1999seemakurthi/Deep_Learning/tree/main/projects/face_emotion_detection) of this project.

#### We here used Opencv to cature face :

##### using Cam
##### using Screen capturing

And then trained A TF model to detect the emotion the fce pocess. Dataset for Facial Emotion Detection is available on Kaggle. It has roughly 36,000 image dataset containing 7 types of emotions.
But, here considered only 4 of then have been considered. Those are :

* Happiness
* Surprise
* Neutral
* Disgusted

And By saving the trained model Facce_emotion.h5 and basic opencv face detection, we can predict the face emotion of a person using **cam**, as well as using **Sreen capturing** .
