# Self-Driving-Car-Prototype
For collecting the dataset you need a car simulator  
Download it from here: https://github.com/kushal1999seemakurthi/Deep_Learning/tree/main/projects/Self-Driving-Car-Prototype-main

Extract it and then run the exe file.  
Run the car for few minutes on the track.  
Simulator will be saving frames and steering angles simultaneously.  
This collected dataset will act as our supervised data on which we will train and test our model.
