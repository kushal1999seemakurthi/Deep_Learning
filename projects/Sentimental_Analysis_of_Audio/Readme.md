# Sentimental Analysis on Audio Data

### Download it from here: [Reposity](https://github.com/kushal1999seemakurthi/Deep_Learning/tree/main/projects/Sentimental_Analysis_of_Audio)

* For this project I used a data set, which contains eight types of emotional audio.
* In this project we have used buch of libraries but one of the main libraries used is Librosa
* In addition to that library we used tensorflows framework to deploy DL models along with that numpy also been extensively used.

* Using a librosa we extracted audio data into MFCCs of matrices of 54 X 44
### Later to train, the planning models were deployed such as LSTM model, CNN model, LSTM + CNN model.
Results are also attached below.

Results from the attached models can be map by using the following list
* 'mapping' : ['neutral', 'calm', 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'fearful', 'disgust', 'surprise']
